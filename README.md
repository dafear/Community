#The name of my web app is "Community", - it's a responsive web app meant to help non-profits  organize their constituents. 


#My first screen (entry.png) shot shows the entry portal to my web app.  
My next screen shot (interface.png) shows the base page 

#This link and my final screen shot show my user flows and wire frames *(note) my final shot (wireframe.png) is the actual calendar interface that I'll be using in my final design specs after re-sizing:

##Summary-The Bronx Culture Collective is a nonprofit organization designed to facilitate partnerships between Bronx-based arts/cultural organizations and instituations. The membership varies from large organizations such as museums to smaller neighborhood based community centers. BCC is searching for a way to utilize a central calendar to enforce collaboration between the groups. For example, when one group posts an event, the other groups can share that event with their members as well to promote cross-collaboration and increased turn out.  

This interface is designed to enable the users to organize large groups of event submissions to a central calendar fed through their database. The steps include-signing up through the entry portal, receiving a gift, and being added to the user database. I am utilizing the Google Calendar API to provide increased functionality in accomplishing this task. The biggest challenge is keeping a successful data flow from their data base of membership to the calendar and maintaining clear visibility for the users. 


##Technical Aspects- Html5, javaScript, CSS, jquery, API data
